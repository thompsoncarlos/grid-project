## "Product In Stock"
At MB we develop and maintain high quality web applications that cover a broad range of necessities. Which is why we expect our developers to feel at home in all areas of modern Frontend development. Expressive markup, crossbrowser/crossdevice working CSS styles and lean JavaScript code should therefore be on your high priority list.

*All the provided data (namely: car names, images and prices) is not to be taken as real and is only relevant as example/"dummy" data for use in this exercise.*

## Download
Please **download the challenge zip file** to your computer.

## Implement
Read very carefully all **instructions in the README.md** file before you begin with the implementation.

Use **your IDE** of choice and implement your solution **inside the "mb-project-entry platform exam" folder**.

Do NOT delete or change any other files (like "<platform exam>.marker" and "IMPORTANT") in the root folder as those will be needed to upload your solution.

___
> ***Please ignore: Git, "in-browser editor" and Platform Exam Built-in console.***
> *Although in the <platform exam> Test web pages there are mentions to using a "Git repository" or Platform Exam "in-browser editor", please ignore that as you should be implementing only in your local machine without any git repository or commits log.
> The <platform exam> Test web pages also mention a "Built-in console" to Build and Run tests in the browser, again, please ignore that as you should only run builds and tests (as requested in the README.md instructions) in your local machine.*

## Upload
When done, please **zip your solution**: zip the folder generated when you unzipped the challenge initially, which contains some files - like "<platform exam>.marker" and "IMPORTANT" - and the "mb-project-entry platform exam" folder (with your files inside).

*PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE THE `node_modules` folder*.

Then **upload it** in Platform Exam web page in the appropriate section.

Make sure you do it **before reaching the Test time limit**, otherwise you will not be able to do it afterwards.

Good luck :-)
